# crest

crest is a restlet framework http://restlet.org wrapper written in clojure. Restlet is a framework that supports the REST concepts covering both the client and the server side in a uniform interface. Restlet makes it easy for applications using RESTful service to communicate with each other using this uniform interface. crest adds abstraction on top of restlet api in an attempt to make it easy to use the framework without having to learn much about it.

  (.start component)
  ; client code
  (println (GET "http://localhost:8111/app1/get1")) ; value returned by fn1 will be shown
  (println (GET "http://localhost:8111/app1/get2")) ; value returned by fn2 will be shown
